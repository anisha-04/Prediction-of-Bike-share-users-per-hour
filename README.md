In this project, we will be exploring a dataset that provides information on a bike-sharing system.

The traditional bike rentals process involves setting up a membership, renting a bike from a store, and returning it back to that store. Everything has become automatic in a new generation of bike-sharing systems. This system has made users able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back to another position. There are, currently about 500 thousand bicycles composed out of the 500 bike-sharing programs around the world, therefore, there exists a great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental, and health issues.

Also, the data set records explicitly the duration of travel, departure, and arrival positions of the vehicles. And thus, this feature turns the bike-sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. The data is collected from the website: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset. This dataset contains the hourly and daily count of rental bikes between the years 2011 and 2012 in the Capital Bikeshare system along with the corresponding weather and seasonal information. The data is collected from Portugal.

The data was accessed and downloaded on 2 December 2021 at 11:10 AM. The data set might get modified on this page, there is a copy of the actual data set from the date 2 December 2021, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uLdlFudxeybT1mGVxFFCmzqJun2KoQZL/view?usp=sharing ,which is the copy we will be working on.

In this project, our primary goal would be to predict the total number of users renting the bike per hour. And we will be using machine learning models and would be focusing on the other interesting things related to it.
